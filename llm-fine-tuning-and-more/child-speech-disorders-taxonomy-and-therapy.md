## 1. disorder classification and taxonomy

### 1.1 speech sound disorders (ssds) - overarching category

speech sound disorders (ssds) is a generic term describing a range of difficulties producing speech sounds in children. ssds refer to any difficulty or combination of difficulties with:
- perception (how sounds are heard and processed)
- motor production (physical ability to produce sounds)
- phonological representation (cognitive understanding of sound patterns)

### 1.2 etiological classification

#### 1.2.1 organic ssds
disorders resulting from identifiable structural, neurological, or sensory causes:

**a. motor/neurological disorders**
- childhood apraxia of speech (cas)
- dysarthria (pediatric)

**b. structural abnormalities**
- cleft lip/palate
- velopharyngeal dysfunction (vpd)
- other craniofacial anomalies
- tongue-tie (ankyloglossia)

**c. sensory/perceptual disorders**
- hearing loss
- auditory processing difficulties

#### 1.2.2 idiopathic ssds
disorders with no known cause (most common type):

**a. functional articulation disorders**
- difficulty producing specific speech sounds
- motor-based production errors
- typically affect specific phonemes (sounds)

**b. phonological disorders**
- pattern-based errors affecting multiple sounds
- cognitive-linguistic basis
- involve phonological processes (simplification patterns)

**c. inconsistent speech disorder**
- highly variable speech productions
- difficulty with motor planning
- 10+ inconsistent productions out of 25-word sample

### 1.3 specific disorder types

- **definition**: difficulty with motor production of specific speech sounds
- **characteristics**: consistent substitution, omission, or distortion of particular phonemes
- **typical sounds affected**: /r/, /l/, /s/, /z/, /sh/, /ch/, /th/
- **etiology**: motor learning difficulties, structural issues, or unknown

#### 1.3.2 phonological disorders
- **definition**: pattern-based errors affecting classes of sounds
- **characteristics**: systematic simplification patterns (phonological processes)
- **basis**: cognitive-linguistic; child doesn't understand the rules for using sounds to change word meanings
- **common patterns**:
  - fronting (back sounds replaced with front sounds: "tar" for "car")
  - stopping (fricatives replaced with stops: "top" for "shop")
  - cluster reduction ("poon" for "spoon")
  - final consonant deletion ("ca" for "cat")
  - gliding (/r/ or /l/ replaced with /w/ or /y/)
  - prevocalic voicing (voiceless sounds become voiced at word beginning)
  - devoicing (voiced sounds become voiceless)

#### 1.3.3 childhood apraxia of speech (cas)
- **definition**: motor speech disorder involving impaired planning and programming of speech movements
- **key characteristics**:
  - enormous variability in speech sound production
  - inconsistent errors (same word produced differently each time)
  - difficulty with prosody (stress, rhythm, intonation)

  - requires enormous effort for even short phrases
  - errors increase with utterance length/complexity
- **diagnosis**: must demonstrate core features of inconsistency, prosodic abnormalities, and coarticulation errors
- **muscle function**: no muscle weakness or paralysis (distinguishes from dysarthria)

#### 1.3.4 pediatric dysarthria

#### 1.3.5 fluency disorders (stuttering)
- **definition**: disruptions in speech flow characterized by repetitions, prolongations, and blocks
- **characteristics**:
  - repetitions of syllables, words, or sounds
  - prolongations (stretching sounds)

- **companion tool**: designed to be used with gfta-3
- **provides**: detailed diagnostic information about phonological patterns
- **analyzes**: presence and frequency of phonological processes

### 4.3 phonological analysis approaches

#### 4.3.1 phonetic transcription
- narrow phonetic transcription using international phonetic alphabet (ipa)
- integral part of assessment
- informs all aspects of clinical management

#### 4.3.2 phonological process analysis
- identify systematic error patterns:
  - substitution processes (fronting, stopping, gliding)
  - syllable structure processes (cluster reduction, final consonant deletion)
  - assimilation processes (sounds becoming more like neighboring sounds)
- determine which processes are age-appropriate vs. atypical
- assess severity based on frequency and types of processes

#### 4.3.3 phonetic inventory
- document all sounds child can produce
- sounds produced correctly, in error, and not attempted
- helps determine stimulability

#### 4.3.4 stimulability testing
- can child produce error sounds when given model/cues?
- highly stimulable sounds often resolve without direct treatment
- guides target selection

### 4.4 intelligibility measurement

#### 4.4.1 percentage consonants correct (pcc)
- **calculation**: (correct consonants / total consonant opportunities) × 100
- **sample**: 5-10 minute conversational speech
- **severity levels**:
  - mild: pcc value above established cutoff
  - mild-moderate: mid-range pcc
  - moderate-severe: lower pcc range
  - severe: lowest pcc range
- **correlates with**: perceptual severity and speech intelligibility
- **pcc-r (revised)**: includes substitutions and omissions, excludes distortions
- **recommended for**: 3-6 year old monolingual english speakers with speech delays

#### 4.4.2 subjective intelligibility ratings
- percentage of words/utterances understood
- rated in connected speech
- context: familiar vs. unfamiliar listeners

### 4.5 assessment for specific disorders

#### 4.5.1 childhood apraxia of speech (cas)
- **must demonstrate**:
  - inconsistent errors on repeated productions
  - lengthened and disrupted coarticulatory transitions
  - inappropriate prosody (especially realized through equal stress)
- **additional features**:
  - increased errors with length/complexity
  - groping/struggle behaviors
  - better performance on automatic vs. volitional speech

#### 4.5.2 stuttering
- **assess**:
  - frequency and types of disfluencies
  - secondary behaviors
  - awareness and emotional reactions
  - impact on communication and participation
- **onset**: typically 2-4 years (average 33 months)
- **monitoring approach**: if onset within 6 months and minimal adverse effects

#### 4.5.3 voice disorders
- **perceptual assessment**:
  - vocal quality (hoarseness, breathiness, strain)
  - pitch (appropriate for age/gender)
  - loudness (adequate, excessive, reduced)
- **behavioral observations**: vocal behaviors (throat clearing, yelling)
- **referral**: to otolaryngologist (ent) for vocal fold visualization

- **imperative**: evaluate in native language(s)
- **use**: interpreter or bilingual clinician
- **composite measures**: combining data from both languages increases diagnostic accuracy
- **cross-linguistic effects**: normal part of multilingual development
- **avoid misdiagnosis**: distinguish difference from disorder

#### 4.6.2 specific approaches
- **speech assessment of children's home languages (sachl)**: collaborative approach using family/interpreter expertise
- **assess**: gross and discrete phonological abilities across languages
- **composite phonological abilities**: superior diagnostic tool for bilingual children

#### 4.6.3 indian language considerations
- **limited standardized tools**: for hindi, tamil, telugu, and other indian languages
- **phonological development**: varies by language
- **research findings**:
  - tamil: 15 phonological processes identified; most suppressed by age 3
  - telugu: early acquisition of plosives and nasals
  - hindi: phonological skills develop with age; limited normative data
- **multilingual environment**: common risk factor in indian studies

## 5. intervention approaches

### 5.1 treatment selection framework

**factors influencing intervention choice**:
- disorder type (articulation vs. phonological vs. motor-based)
- severity (mild to severe)
- age of child
- number of errors
- stimulability
- phonological awareness abilities
- comorbid conditions
- family priorities and context

### 5.2 articulation-based approaches

#### 5.2.1 traditional articulation therapy
- **focus**: motor production of specific sounds
- **hierarchy**:
  1. sound isolation
  2. syllable level
  3. word level (initial, medial, final positions)
  4. phrase level
  5. sentence level
  6. conversation level
  7. generalization
- **techniques**:
  - auditory discrimination
  - sound placement cues (visual, tactile, verbal)
  - shaping (gradual approximation)
  - practice and drill
- **appropriate for**: children with functional articulation disorders, older children with few errors

### 5.3 phonological approaches

#### 5.3.1 cycles approach
- **developer**: hodson
- **principle**: stimulate emergence of phonological patterns, not mastery
- **structure**:
  - target one primary pattern for fixed time (cycle)
  - rotate through all patterns
  - repeat cycles with more complex targets
- **typical cycle length**: 2-6 hours per pattern
- **patterns targeted**: final consonants, velars, liquids, clusters
- **no mastery required**: within each cycle
- **appropriate for**: children with multiple phonological processes; moderate-severe ssd
- **evidence**: prominent method with research support
- **not for**: motor pattern generation (focuses on phonological representations)

#### 5.3.2 minimal pairs approach
- **principle**: use word contrasts differing by one sound to highlight meaning changes
- **example pairs**: "pea" vs. "tea", "shoe" vs. "sue"
- **child realizes**: error changes word meaning
- **focus**: phonological awareness and self-monitoring
- **procedure**:
  - present word pairs
  - child produces both
  - feedback on meaning distinction
- **appropriate for**: older children, children with few errors, mild ssd

#### 5.3.3 maximal oppositions approach
- **principle**: contrast sounds differing across multiple features
- **example**: "bun" vs. "sun" (differ in place, manner, voice)
- **targets**: maximally different sounds
- **theory**: greater generalization to untreated sounds
- **appropriate for**: children with multiple errors across sound classes

#### 5.3.4 multiple oppositions approach
- **principle**: target several sound errors simultaneously
- **structure**: contrast 4 sounds at once
- **targets**: sounds involved in global phoneme collapse (one sound replaces many)
- **example set**: if child says [d] for /t, k, g, s/, contrast all four with [d]
- **appropriate for**: severe ssd, young children, global phoneme collapses impacting intelligibility
- **minimum dose**: 50 trials over 30 sessions (higher doses 70+ for severe cases)

#### 5.3.5 phonological awareness integration
- **principle**: combine sound awareness with production practice
- **activities**:
  - rhyming
  - syllable segmentation
  - phoneme identification
  - sound manipulation
- **incorporates**: letter-sound knowledge when age-appropriate
- **benefit**: supports literacy development
- **appropriate for**: children age 4+ with ssd and literacy risk

### 5.4 motor-based approaches

#### 5.4.1 principles of motor learning
- **used for**: childhood apraxia of speech, dysarthria, severe motor-based ssds
- **key principles**:
  - high practice frequency (100+ trials per session)
  - systematic progression from simple to complex
  - variable practice contexts
  - appropriate feedback (knowledge of results/performance)
  - blocked vs. random practice schedules

#### 5.4.2 dynamic temporal and tactile cueing (dttc)
- **for**: childhood apraxia of speech
- **principles**:
  - bottom-up approach (simple to complex movement patterns)
  - intensive practice
  - systematic cueing hierarchy (heavy to light support)
  - focus on prosody and coarticulation
- **starts with**: functional words (child's priorities)

#### 5.4.3 prompt (prompts for restructuring oral muscular phonetic targets)
- **approach**: tactile-kinesthetic-proprioceptive cues
- **therapist provides**: specific tactile prompts on face/jaw
- **integrates**: motor, sensory, cognitive, linguistic aspects
- **trained approach**: requires specific training
- **evidence**: limited; some studies show small benefits with tactile cues
- **for**: motor planning/programming difficulties

#### 5.4.4 integral stimulation
- **technique**: "watch me, listen to me, do what i do"
- **cueing hierarchy**: decreasing support as child improves
- **focus**: auditory, visual, and tactile modeling
- **for**: motor-based difficulties including cas

### 5.5 integrated and hybrid approaches

#### 5.5.1 core vocabulary approach
- **for**: inconsistent speech disorder
- **principle**: practice consistent production of functional words
- **targets**: 50-70 high-frequency words child needs
- **focus**: motor consistency, not phoneme accuracy
- **practice**: intensive drill for automaticity

#### 5.5.2 metaphon therapy
- **principle**: metalinguistic approach
- **phases**:
  - phase 1: concept development (understanding sound properties)
  - phase 2: sound development (production practice)
- **activities**: auditory discrimination, sound awareness games
- **appropriate for**: children with phonological disorders and adequate cognitive-linguistic skills

#### 5.5.3 nuffield dyspraxia programme
- **for**: childhood apraxia of speech and severe ssds
- **structured program**: systematic progression through sound and syllable combinations
- **focus**: building motor skills hierarchically
- **evidence**: used commonly in uk/australia

### 5.6 approaches with limited or negative evidence

#### 5.6.1 non-speech oral motor exercises (nsomes)
- **examples**: tongue push-ups, blowing exercises, oral massage
- **evidence**: current literature clear that these do not produce speech changes
- **rationale**: non-speech behaviors are not precursors to speech
- **will not**: establish speech productions, "warm up" for speech, or build speaking foundation
- **exception**: may be appropriate for feeding/swallowing disorders, not speech

#### 5.6.2 blowing/sucking exercises for vpd
- **evidence**: not effective for improving velopharyngeal closure or resonance
- **treatment instead**: surgery and/or speech therapy targeting articulation

### 5.7 fluency intervention approaches

#### 5.7.1 palin parent-child interaction (pci)
- **focus**: family-based approach for preschool stuttering
- **strategies**:
  - adapting speech rates
  - allowing child to lead during play
  - maintaining eye contact
  - reducing communication demands
- **parent coaching**: emphasizes parental interaction strategies

#### 5.7.2 direct fluency therapy
- **techniques**:
  - easy onset (gentle start to words)
  - light articulatory contacts
  - slow/stretched speech
  - pausing and phrasing
- **combined with**: confidence building, desensitization

### 5.8 treatment intensity and dosage

#### 5.8.1 general recommendations
- **session duration**: 30-45 minutes (30 minutes for young children due to attention)
- **frequency**: 2-3 times per week (majority of studies use 2x/week)
- **trials per session**: 50-100 production trials recommended
  - minimum: 23 trials
  - average: 77 trials
  - maximum: 200 trials
  - severe cases: 70+ trials needed
- **distributed vs. massed**: mixed findings; some evidence for 3x/week over 8 weeks better than 1x/week over 24 weeks

#### 5.8.2 childhood apraxia of speech specific
- **frequency**: 3-5 days per week (consensus recommendation)
- **intensity**: intensive and frequent required
- **or**: 4 times per week in blocks of 12-16 sessions, followed by 4-6 week break

#### 5.8.3 severity considerations
- **greater intensity**: yields greater outcomes
- **adjust intensity**: based on severity and progress
- **severe ssd**: requires higher doses (70+ trials, more frequent sessions)

### 5.9 parent involvement and home practice

#### 5.9.1 rationale for parent coaching
- **evidence**: caregiver participation leads to better outcomes
- **coached caregivers**: children make significantly more progress
- **time**: parents spend much more time with child than therapist
- **natural contexts**: learning occurs during everyday activities

#### 5.9.2 parent coaching model
- **structure**: parents attend sessions alongside child
- **learn**: techniques to help child at home
- **practice**: during therapy with therapist feedback
- **carryover**: implement in daily routines
- **goals**: build parent competence, confidence, enjoyment

#### 5.9.3 strategies taught to parents
- follow child's lead in play
- pause and wait for responses
- use communication temptations
- offer choices
- comment on actions
- model appropriate speech/language
- integrate practice into bathtime, mealtime, playtime, daily routines

#### 5.9.4 home practice activities
- provided at end of each session
- specific to child's current goals
- functional and meaningful
- achievable within family's context and priorities

## 7. clinical decision-making pathways

### 7.1 evidence-based practice framework

#### 7.1.1 three components of ebp
**a. external evidence**: best current scientific literature
**b. internal evidence**: clinical data from assessment and progress monitoring
**c. client perspective**: patient/family values, circumstances, priorities

#### 7.1.2 d.e.c.i.d.e. framework
a framework to guide ebp process:
- **d**: define the clinical question
- **e**: evidence search
- **c**: critically appraise evidence
- **i**: integrate evidence with clinical expertise and patient values
- **d**: decision making
- **e**: evaluate outcomes

### 7.2 systematic clinical decision-making process

#### step 1: comprehensive assessment
- gather information about:
  - child's speech sound abilities (inventory, errors, patterns)
  - stimulability
  - language skills
  - phonological awareness
  - hearing status
  - oral mechanism
  - family context and priorities
  - developmental history

#### step 2: diagnosis and severity determination
- classify disorder type:
  - articulation vs. phonological vs. motor-based
  - organic vs. idiopathic
  - presence of comorbidities
- determine severity:
  - percentage consonants correct (pcc)
  - intelligibility ratings
  - impact on participation
  - age-appropriateness of errors

#### step 3: prognosis determination
**favorable prognostic indicators**:
- younger age (earlier intervention)
- higher stimulability
- no comorbid conditions
- supportive family environment
- mild-moderate severity
- typical phonological processes for age

**unfavorable prognostic indicators**:
- late presentation (age 6+)
- poor stimulability
- comorbid language disorder
- limited family support/resources
- severe disorder
- atypical or unusual error patterns
- cas diagnosis

#### step 4: goal selection
**criteria for target selection**:
- **developmental appropriateness**: age when sound typically emerges
- **stimulability**: more stimulable sounds may resolve without direct treatment
- **functional impact**: affects intelligibility significantly
- **frequency**: common sounds in language
- **phonological patterns**: target patterns affecting multiple sounds
- **family priorities**: meaningful to child and family
- **complexity**: research supports targeting more complex sounds for generalization

**number of targets**:
- traditional articulation: 1-2 sounds
- phonological approaches: 1-2 patterns
- multiple oppositions: 4 sounds simultaneously
- varies by approach and severity

#### step 5: intervention approach selection

**decision tree**:

**if few errors (1-3 sounds), older child, mild ssd**:
→ traditional articulation therapy or minimal pairs

**if multiple phonological processes, moderate-severe ssd**:
→ cycles approach, maximal oppositions, or multiple oppositions

**if motor-based disorder (cas, dysarthria)**:
→ motor learning principles, dttc, prompt, integral stimulation

**if inconsistent speech disorder**:
→ core vocabulary approach

**if stuttering**:
→ if onset <6 months: monitor
→ if persistent or impactful: palin pci (preschool) or direct fluency therapy (school-age)

**if voice disorder**:
→ ent referral + vocal hygiene education + voice therapy if appropriate

**if resonance disorder**:
→ assess vpd; may need surgical consultation + articulation therapy

#### step 6: treatment planning
- determine:
  - session frequency (typically 2-3x/week)
  - session duration (30-45 minutes)
  - treatment intensity (number of trials)
  - parent involvement plan
  - home practice activities

#### step 7: implementation
- begin intervention with selected approach
- engage family/caregivers
- provide coaching and home activities
- maintain high practice frequency within sessions

#### step 8: progress monitoring
- collect data each session:
  - accuracy on target sounds/patterns
  - generalization to untreated sounds/contexts
  - changes in intelligibility
  - functional communication improvements
- review data regularly (every 4-6 weeks)

#### step 9: decision point - continue or modify
**if adequate progress**:
→ continue current approach
→ advance to next level in hierarchy
→ add new targets

**if inadequate progress**:
→ analyze why (inappropriate targets, insufficient intensity, poor compliance, etc.)
→ modify approach (change targets, increase intensity, change technique)
→ consider reassessment
→ consider referrals (hearing re-check, medical evaluation, etc.)

**if goals met**:
→ advance to next phase
→ focus on generalization and carryover
→ plan for discharge when functional communication achieved

#### step 10: discharge planning
**criteria for discharge**:
- age-appropriate speech sound production
- intelligible in all contexts
- functional communication
- sounds maintaining in conversation
- family satisfied with outcomes

**discharge plan includes**:
- summary of progress
- recommendations for ongoing monitoring
- home activities to maintain skills
- plan for follow-up if needed

### 7.3 special considerations in decision-making

#### 7.3.1 multilingual children
- assess in all languages spoken
- use interpreter or bilingual slp when possible
- distinguish difference from disorder
- consider cross-linguistic transfer effects
- involve family in understanding expectations for each language
- may target one language with expectation of transfer

#### 7.3.2 comorbid language disorder
- speech and language goals may be integrated
- consider literacy impact and include phonological awareness
- may need longer/more intensive intervention
- coordinate with other professionals (special educators, reading specialists)

#### 7.3.3 literacy concerns
- assess phonological awareness for children age 4+
- integrate literacy activities if child at risk
- coordinate with educational team
- monitor reading and spelling development

#### 7.3.4 rural/underserved populations
- consider access barriers (travel, cost, time)
- maximize parent coaching for home practice
- consider teletherapy options
- may need more intensive blocks of treatment (e.g., week-long intensive)
- partner with community health workers for screening and monitoring

#### 7.3.5 low resource contexts
- prioritize functional, meaningful goals
- use minimal materials (can be improvised)
- emphasize parent/caregiver as co-therapist
- focus on naturalistic intervention in daily routines
- may use group therapy models when appropriate

## 8. developmental milestones for speech sounds

### 8.1 speech sound acquisition timeline

#### early developing sounds (by age 3)
- **consonants**: /p/, /b/, /m/, /t/, /d/, /n/, /h/, /w/, /k/, /g/, /f/, /ng/, /y/
- **note**: 90% of children master these by age 2-3 years

#### middle developing sounds (by age 4-5)
- **consonants**: /v/, /j/, /s/, /ch/, /l/, /sh/, /z/
- **note**: most children acquire by age 4-5 years

#### late developing sounds (by age 6-7)
- **consonants**: /r/, voiced /th/, /zh/, voiceless /th/
- **note**: may develop up to age 7-8 years

#### general timeline
- **by age 4**: most sounds acquired
- **by age 7**: almost all english speech sounds acquired
- **variation**: standard deviation of 6-18 months depending on sound
- **90% criterion**: ages represent when 90% of children produce sound correctly at word level

### 8.2 phonological process suppression timeline

#### by age 3 years
- **final consonant deletion**: should be eliminated
- **fronting**: should be eliminated by age 3;6
- **stopping of /f/ and /s/**: should be resolved by age 3;0

#### by age 3;6 years
- **stopping of /v/ and /z/**: should be resolved

#### by age 4 years
- **cluster reduction** (without /s/): should be resolved

#### by age 4;6 years
- **stopping of /sh/, /j/, /ch/**: should be resolved

#### by age 5 years
- **cluster reduction** (with /s/): should be resolved
- **stopping of /th/**: should be resolved
- **most phonological processes**: eliminated by age 5

### 8.3 age-appropriate error patterns

#### ages 2-3 years
acceptable patterns:
- final consonant deletion
- cluster reduction
- fronting
- stopping of fricatives
- gliding

#### ages 3-4 years
acceptable patterns (diminishing):
- cluster reduction
- stopping of later-developing sounds (sh, ch, j, th)
- gliding of /r/ and /l/

#### ages 4-5 years
most processes should be eliminated; may still see:
- difficulty with /r/, /l/, /th/
- cluster reduction with /s/ clusters

#### age 5+ years
- isolated difficulty with /r/, /th/
- most other errors warrant evaluation

### 9.4 key considerations for ai/llm development

this hierarchical structure provides:

**layer 1**: identification and referral system
- who identifies, when, what red flags
- prevalence data at different ages

**layer 2**: comprehensive assessment components
- all evaluation tools, methods, measures
- standardized tests used (gfta-3, deap, klpa-3)
- indian language considerations

**layer 3**: diagnosis and classification
- complete taxonomy of all disorder types
- prevalence, causes, characteristics for each
- severity determination methods

**layer 4**: treatment planning
- goal selection criteria (smart goals)
- approach selection based on disorder type
- dosage parameters (frequency, intensity, trials)
- parent involvement models

**layer 5**: intervention delivery
- specific therapy techniques for each disorder
- hierarchy progressions
- evidence levels (strong, limited, negative)
- indian slp curriculum and training

**layer 6**: outcomes and monitoring
- progress tracking methods
- decision points for modification
- discharge criteria and follow-up

this structure supports ai systems for:
- differential diagnosis support
- treatment recommendation engines
- progress prediction models
- clinical decision support tools
- training and education platforms

### 9.2 clinical reasoning pathways

the clinical decision-making section (section 7) provides logical pathways from:
- assessment → diagnosis → prognosis → goal selection → intervention selection → implementation → monitoring → modification/discharge

### 9.3 prevalence and epidemiology

comprehensive prevalence data provided for:
- global populations
- indian populations
- age-specific rates
- gender differences
- comorbidity patterns

### 9.4 evidence base

approaches noted with:
- strong evidence (cycles approach, minimal pairs, motor learning principles)
- limited evidence (prompt, inconsistency approach)
- negative evidence (non-speech oral motor exercises)

### 9.5 cultural and linguistic diversity

special attention to:
- multilingual assessment and intervention
- indian language considerations
- indian slp training and curriculum
- adaptations for low-resource contexts

## appendix: common phonological processes

### substitution processes
- **fronting**: velar or palatal sounds replaced with alveolar (tar/car, tip/ship)
- **stopping**: fricatives or affricates replaced with stops (top/stop, do/zoo)
- **gliding**: liquids /r/ or /l/ replaced with glides /w/ or /y/ (wed/red, yike/like)
- **deaffrication**: affricates replaced with fricatives (ship/chip)
- **vocalization**: syllabic /l/ or /r/ replaced with vowel (bottoh/bottle)

### syllable structure processes
- **cluster reduction**: consonant cluster simplified (tar/star, poon/spoon)
- **final consonant deletion**: final consonant omitted (ca/cat, bu/bus)
- **weak syllable deletion**: unstressed syllable omitted (nana/banana, ephant/elephant)
- **reduplication**: syllable repeated (wawa/water, baba/bottle)

### assimilation processes
- **velar assimilation**: sound becomes velar due to nearby velar (gog/dog)
- **labial assimilation**: sound becomes labial due to nearby labial (bub/bus)
- **nasal assimilation**: sound becomes nasal due to nearby nasal (nunny/funny)
- **prevocalic voicing**: voiceless consonant becomes voiced before vowel (big/pig)
- **devoicing**: voiced consonant becomes voiceless (especially in final position: cat/cad)

### unusual/atypical processes (warrant concern)
- **initial consonant deletion**: omitting first sound of word
- **backing**: front sounds replaced with back sounds (gat/that)
- **glottal replacement**: sounds replaced with glottal stop
- **metathesis**: sounds in word reversed (aminal/animal, pasghetti/spaghetti)
