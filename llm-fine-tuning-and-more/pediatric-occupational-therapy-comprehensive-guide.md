- **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**:
  - India: 1 in 100 children (estimated 2-3 million children)
  - Global: 1 in 160 children (WHO)
- **ADHD**:
  - India: 11.32% prevalence in school-aged children
  - Global: 5-7% of children
- **Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)**:
  - 45% of children with DCD show atypical sensory processing

- **Self-care**: Dressing, feeding, bathing, toileting
- **Productivity**: School tasks, homework, household chores
- **Play and Leisure**: Social play, sports, hobbies, creative activities
- **Rest and Sleep**: Sleep routines, bedtime behaviors
- **Social Participation**: Peer interactions, family activities, community involvement

### 2.2 Scope of Pediatric OT Practice

Pediatric occupational therapists work with children who have:

1. **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, cerebral palsy, developmental coordination disorder
2. **Sensory processing difficulties**: Over-responsivity, under-responsivity, sensory seeking
3. **Learning disabilities**: Dysgraphia, visual-motor integration deficits
4. **Physical disabilities**: Congenital abnormalities, acquired injuries
5. **Mental health conditions**: Anxiety, trauma-related difficulties
6. **Genetic conditions**: Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome

### 2.3 Indian Context for Pediatric OT

**Unique Considerations:**

- **Limited awareness**: OT is less known than physiotherapy or speech therapy in India
- **Resource constraints**: Shortage of pediatric OTs, especially in rural areas
- **Cultural factors**: Joint family systems, educational pressures, stigma around disabilities
- **Infrastructure gaps**: Limited sensory integration equipment in clinics

## 6. Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis in pediatric OT involves distinguishing between conditions with overlapping symptoms to guide appropriate intervention.

### 6.1 Overlapping Presentations

**Common Challenge**: Children with autism share symptoms with those with other neurodevelopmental disorders (intellectual disability, communication disorders), making accurate diagnosis complex.

**Key Considerations:**
- Multiple diagnoses often co-occur
- Symptoms may overlap but require different intervention approaches
- Ongoing assessment may clarify diagnostic picture over time

### 6.2 Sensory Processing Patterns Across Diagnoses

| Diagnosis | Sensory Processing Patterns | Prevalence of Sensory Issues |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Autism Spectrum Disorder** | Hyper and hypo-responsivity, sensory seeking, modulation difficulties across all systems | 90-95% |
| **ADHD** | Sensory seeking, difficulty filtering sensory information, modulation challenges | 85.2% |
| **DCD** | Proprioceptive and vestibular processing differences, some tactile sensitivities | 45% |
| **Typically Developing** | Mild sensory preferences | 16-25.7% |

**Clinical Implication**: Sensory processing difficulties alone do not indicate a specific diagnosis; pattern analysis and comprehensive evaluation are essential.

### 6.3 Differential Diagnosis Decision Points

#### Sensory Processing Disorder vs. Autism vs. ADHD

**When Sensory Issues are Primary:**

| Feature | SPD (Standalone) | ASD with Sensory | ADHD with Sensory |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Social Communication** | Typical development | Impaired (core feature) | Typical, but may struggle due to impulsivity |
| **Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors** | Minimal; sensory-driven | Present (core feature) | Minimal; may be fidgeting |
| **Attention** | May be affected by sensory input | Variable; often focused on restricted interests | Impaired (core feature) |
| **Response to Sensory Strategies** | Excellent; primary need | Helpful but not sufficient | Helpful for regulation |

**Important Consideration**: Some experts argue diagnosing SPD alone may cause ASD and ADHD to go undiagnosed. Always screen for core features of these conditions.

#### DCD vs. Dyspraxia vs. Autism with Motor Difficulties

| Feature | DCD | Dyspraxia (Motor Planning) | ASD with Motor Issues |
|---------|-----|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Primary Deficit** | Coordination and skill acquisition | Motor planning and sequencing | Variable; often dyspraxia + coordination |
| **Social Communication** | Typical | Typical | Impaired |
| **Cognitive** | Typically average or above | Typically average or above | Variable |
| **Sensory** | 45% have sensory issues | Often present | 90-95% have sensory issues |
| **Response to Intervention** | Task-specific training, CO-OP effective | Motor planning strategies, CO-OP | Sensory-motor integration, visual supports |

**Note**: Dyspraxia and DCD often overlap; some use terms interchangeably while others see dyspraxia as motor planning subset of DCD.

#### ADHD vs. Sensory Seeking vs. Anxiety

**Child presents with constant movement, difficulty sitting still, appearing distracted:**

| Indicator | Suggests ADHD | Suggests Sensory Seeking | Suggests Anxiety |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Context** | Across all settings | Worse in under-stimulating environments | Worse in stressful/new situations |
| **Response to Movement** | May help briefly but difficulty persists | Helps significantly; seeks it out | May increase (appears more agitated) |
| **Focus when interested** | Can hyperfocus on preferred tasks | Variable | Variable; worry may interfere |
| **Sleep** | Often difficulty falling asleep | May sleep well if sensory needs met | Difficulty due to worry |
| **Social Relationships** | Impulsive, may dominate | Typical when sensory needs met | May avoid due to fear |

### 6.4 Co-Occurring Conditions

**Common Co-Occurrences:**

1. **DCD + ADHD**: 30-50% of children with ADHD have DCD
2. **ASD + ADHD**: 30-50% co-occurrence
3. **ASD + DCD**: 50-80% of children with ASD have motor difficulties
4. **Anxiety + any neurodevelopmental disorder**: High rates across all conditions

**Clinical Approach:**
- Assess for all areas of concern
- Prioritize intervention targets based on functional impact
- Recognize that treating one area (e.g., sensory) may improve another (e.g., attention)

### 6.5 When to Refer for Additional Evaluation

**Refer to developmental pediatrician/neurologist:**
- Suspected ASD, ADHD, or other neurodevelopmental diagnosis
- Regression of skills
- Seizures or neurological concerns
- Complex medical history

**Refer to psychologist:**

## 7. Evidence-Based Interventions

### 7.1 Ayres Sensory Integration (ASI)

**Theoretical Foundation:**
Developed by A. Jean Ayres, ASI theory posits that the brain's ability to organize and interpret sensory information is foundational for learning and behavior.

**Core Principles:**
1. Provides controlled sensory experiences
2. Child-directed, therapist-guided
3. Uses suspended equipment for vestibular and proprioceptive input
4. Adaptive responses to sensory challenges promote brain organization
5. Just-right challenge for intrinsic motivation

**Fidelity Criteria (Parham et al., 2011):**
To be considered true ASI, intervention must include:
- Provision of sensory opportunities (tactile, proprioceptive, vestibular)
- Therapist-child collaboration in activity choice
- Supporting the child's inner drive
- Promoting increasingly complex adaptive responses
- Ensuring physical safety
- Creating an optimal alliance with the child
- Creating a playful environment
- Modifying activity to maximize engagement
- Sensory-rich environment
- Facilitating self-organization

**Evidence Base (2024 Updates):**

### 7.2 Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP)

**Theoretical Foundation:**
CO-OP is a cognitively based, client-centered, performance-oriented intervention using problem-solving strategies and guided discovery to help children achieve functional goals.

**Core Features:**
1. **Top-down approach**: Focus on occupation (functional goals), not impairment
2. **Client-chosen goals**: Child and family select meaningful goals
3. **Cognitive strategy use**: Global strategy (Goal-Plan-Do-Check) + domain-specific strategies
4. **Guided discovery**: Therapist uses questions to help child discover solutions
5. **Dynamic performance analysis**: Identify performance breakdowns
6. **Parent/teacher involvement**: Transfer and generalization

**CO-OP Process (7-step framework):**

**Step 1: Goal Selection**
- Use COPM or similar to identify 3-5 functional goals
- Goals must be meaningful to child
- Specific, measurable, achievable

**Step 2: Cognitive Strategy Introduction**
- Teach global strategy: **Goal-Plan-Do-Check**
  - Goal: What do I want to do?
  - Plan: How am I going to do it?
  - Do: Carry out the plan
  - Check: Did my plan work?

**Step 3: Guided Discovery**
- Therapist uses questions, not instructions
- "What could you try?" vs "Try this"
- Child generates solutions with minimal cues

**Step 4: Dynamic Performance Analysis (DPA)**
- Identify specific performance breakdown
- Guide child to discover solution

**Step 5: Domain-Specific Strategy Use**
- Task analysis (breaking into steps)
- Body position (where should I be?)
- Attention to doing (focus on key aspects)
- Feeling the movement
- Verbal self-guidance

**Step 6: Parent/Teacher Involvement**
- Teach strategy use
- Support practice at home/school
- Promote generalization

**Step 7: Generalization**
- Apply strategies to new, untrained goals
- Transfer learning across contexts

**Evidence Base (2024):**

1. **CO-OP Superior to Standard Care (2022)**: For children with cerebral palsy and spina bifida, CO-OP led to greater goal achievement and transfer effects compared to ordinary treatment.

2. **Meta-Analysis (2022)**: CO-OP improves occupational performance in children with cerebral palsy, though not necessarily more than alternative interventions when compared head-to-head.

3. **Bibliometric Review (2024)**: Research on CO-OP has significantly increased, expanding from DCD to wider range of conditions including cerebral palsy, autism, developmental disabilities.

4. **Parental Coaching RCT (2021)**: CO-OP with parental coaching showed greater activity and participation improvements compared to CO-OP alone for children with DCD.

**Who Benefits from CO-OP:**
- DCD (strongest evidence)
- Cerebral palsy (growing evidence)
- Spina bifida
- Autism spectrum disorder (emerging evidence)
- Brain injury
- Children ages 7+ (requires cognitive understanding of strategy use)

**Advantages:**

- **0**: Expected level achieved
- **-1**: Somewhat less than expected
- **-2**: Much less than expected (current baseline)

**Example Goal:**

*Goal: Aditya will independently put on his school shirt*

- **-2** (Baseline): Aditya requires full physical assistance to put on shirt
- **-1**: Aditya puts arms through sleeves with physical prompts for each step
- **0** (Expected): Aditya independently puts on shirt with verbal reminders to button
- **+1**: Aditya independently puts on shirt and buttons 3/5 buttons without reminders
- **+2**: Aditya independently puts on and buttons shirt completely

**Advantages:**
- Individualized to child and family priorities
- Sensitive to meaningful change
- Can be used with any diagnosis or age
- Culturally adaptable

**Evidence:**
- Responsive measure of functional change in pediatric OT
- Valid for school-based and clinic-based settings
- Widely used in research (CO-OP, ASI, pediatric CP studies)
- Recommended for use with ICF-CY framework

**Use in India:**
- No language or cultural barriers
- Suitable for diverse goals (self-care, school, cultural/religious activities)
- Free, no equipment needed

### 8.3 Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)

**Description:**
Semi-structured interview measuring client-perceived performance and satisfaction in self-identified occupations.

**Process:**
1. Identify occupational performance problems across self-care, productivity, leisure
2. Client rates importance of each problem
3. Select up to 5 most important problems
4. Rate current performance (1-10 scale)
5. Rate current satisfaction (1-10 scale)
6. Re-administer after intervention to measure change

**Scoring:**
- Clinically significant change: 2+ point improvement in performance or satisfaction
- Can calculate total scores (average of ratings)

**Advantages:**
- Client-centered
- Captures what matters to child and family
- Detects meaningful change
- Quick to administer (20-40 minutes)

**Evidence:**
- Widely used in pediatric OT research
- Valid and reliable for children when developmentally appropriate
- Sensitive to change following intervention

**Considerations for Children:**
- Younger children may need parent as primary respondent
- Older children/teens can self-report with support
- Can use pictures or activity cards to facilitate identification

### 8.4 Standardized Assessment Re-Administration

**Approach:**
Re-administer standardized assessments (e.g., MABC-2, Sensory Profile, BOT-2) after intervention period to measure change.

**Advantages:**
- Objective, norm-referenced data
- Can compare to same-age peers
- Useful for research and demonstrating outcomes

**Limitations:**
- May not capture meaningful functional change
- Test-retest effects
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Standardized tools may not be sensitive to individual goals

**When to Use:**

- Revised Knox Preschool Play Scale
- Observe play complexity, social interaction, creativity

**Behavioral Observations:**
- Frequency of target behaviors (e.g., remaining seated, task completion)
- Duration of engagement
- Quality of participation

### 8.7 Parent/Teacher Report

**Questionnaires:**
- Parent satisfaction surveys
- Teacher report of classroom functioning
- Behavior rating scales (e.g., BRIEF for executive function)

**Advantages:**
- Captures functioning in natural contexts
- Multiple perspectives
- Can track generalization

### 8.8 Outcome Measurement Best Practices

**Recommendations:**
1. **Use multiple measures**: Combine standardized, functional, and client-centered measures

1. **Best available research evidence**
2. **Clinical expertise and reasoning**
3. **Client needs, values, and context**

**EBP Process:**

**Step 1: Ask a Clinical Question**
- Use PICO format:
  - **P**opulation: Children with DCD ages 6-10
  - **I**ntervention: CO-OP approach
  - **C**omparison: Standard OT
  - **O**utcome: Functional goal achievement

**Step 2: Search for Evidence**
- Databases: PubMed, OTseeker, CINAHL, Cochrane
- Evidence pyramid: Systematic reviews > RCTs > cohort studies > case studies > expert opinion

**Step 3: Appraise the Evidence**
- Quality of study design
- Relevance to your client
- Applicability in your setting (especially Indian context)

**Step 4: Integrate with Clinical Expertise and Client Values**
- Does research align with what you've observed clinically?
- What does the family prioritize?
- What resources are available?

**Step 5: Implement**
- Select intervention approach
- Collaborate with family on goals
- Monitor progress

**Step 6: Evaluate Outcomes**
- Did intervention work for this child?
- Adjust if needed
- Contribute to evidence base

### 10.2 Clinical Reasoning in Pediatric OT

**Types of Clinical Reasoning:**

**1. Procedural Reasoning** (Scientific reasoning)
- What is the diagnosis/condition?
- What impairments are present?
- What interventions does evidence support?
- Example: Child has DCD, evidence supports CO-OP, therefore use CO-OP

**2. Interactive Reasoning** (Relationship-focused)
- Understanding child's perspective
- Building therapeutic relationship
- Motivating child
- Example: Child loves superheroes, frame intervention using superhero themes

**3. Conditional Reasoning** (Contextual/holistic)
- Considering whole child in context
- How does condition affect child's life?
- What is child's potential?
- Example: Child's school has no OT support, need to train teacher and provide home program

**4. Narrative Reasoning** (Story-making)
- Understanding child's story
- Envisioning future possibilities
- Example: Child struggling in school now, but with intervention, can participate with peers

**5. Pragmatic Reasoning** (Practical constraints)
- Time, resources, reimbursement
- Therapist's skills and training
- Equipment availability
- Example: Clinic lacks sensory gym equipment, adapt using low-cost alternatives

### 10.3 Factors Affecting Clinical Decision-Making

**Research from India and globally identifies:**

**Client Factors:**
- Knowledge and situation of the client
- Severity and complexity of condition
- Family priorities and resources
- Cultural beliefs and practices

**Therapist Factors:**
- Clinical experience and expertise
- Training and certifications
- Personal attitudes and biases
- Self-awareness and reflective practice

**Workplace Conditions:**
- Access to resources and equipment
- Time constraints
- Institutional policies
- Interprofessional collaboration opportunities

**Societal Attitudes:**
- Cultural attitudes toward disability
- Awareness and acceptance of OT
- Stigma and discrimination
- Educational system inclusion

### 10.4 Shared Decision-Making

**Importance:**
Sharing information and decisions with children and families is critical in pediatric rehabilitation. Ethical significance and clinical benefits are established.

**Process:**

**1. Information Exchange**
- Explain assessment findings in understandable terms
- Discuss evidence for intervention options
- Share what to expect (time, effort, outcomes)

**2. Deliberation**
- Explore family's values and priorities
- Discuss pros/cons of options
- Consider child's preferences (when developmentally appropriate)

**3. Decision**
- Collaborative choice of intervention approach
- Agreement on goals
- Plan for monitoring and adjusting

**Child Participation:**
- Even young children can participate (choice of activities, toy preferences)
- Older children/teens should be central to decision-making
- Respect child's autonomy while supporting informed choices

**Indian Context Considerations:**
- Family decision-making often involves extended family
- Respect for elders may influence process
- Father or grandfather may be primary decision-maker in some families
- Balance cultural norms with child's rights and best interests

### 10.5 Ethical Considerations

**Professional Ethics:**
- Beneficence: Act in child's best interest
- Non-maleficence: Do no harm
- Autonomy: Respect child and family choices
- Justice: Equitable access to services
- Confidentiality: Protect child's information

**Common Ethical Dilemmas:**

**1. Scope of Practice**
- Practicing within competence
- Seeking supervision/consultation when needed
- Referring when beyond scope

**2. Cultural Competence**
- Respecting diverse practices while advocating for child
- Navigating disagreements about intervention approaches
- Avoiding imposing Western values

**3. Resource Allocation**
- Limited therapy slots, how to prioritize?
- Balancing individual needs with program constraints
- Advocating for systemic change

**4. Informed Consent**
- Ensuring families truly understand
- Language barriers
- Literacy levels

### 10.6 Clinical Decision Tree: Which Intervention Approach?

**Initial Assessment Completed → Key Decision Points:**

**Decision Point 1: What is the Primary Concern?**

- **Sensory processing difficulties** → Consider ASI if:
  - Child has significant sensory modulation challenges
  - Impacting participation across settings
  - Access to sensory gym or adaptable space
  - Therapist has ASI training
  - If ASI not available: Sensory strategies, environmental modifications, parent education

- **Motor skill deficits (functional goals)** → Consider CO-OP if:
  - Child age 7+ with cognitive ability for strategy use
  - Specific functional goals identified
  - Child motivated to work on goals
  - Therapist trained in CO-OP
  - If CO-OP not suitable: Task-specific training, motor learning approaches

- **Handwriting difficulties** → Consider:
  - Age and grade level (early intervention vs compensation)
  - Underlying factors (visual-motor, motor control, sensory, attention)
  - Task-specific handwriting intervention
  - Assistive technology if persistent/severe
  - Accommodations for academic success during intervention

- **Self-care deficits** → Consider:
  - Task-specific training in natural contexts
  - Adaptive equipment
  - Environmental modifications
  - Parent training for carryover

**Decision Point 2: What Resources are Available?**

- **Well-equipped clinic with sensory gym** → ASI is option
- **School-based with limited equipment** → CO-OP, task-specific, consultation model
- **Telehealth** → Parent coaching, CO-OP (adapted), environmental modifications
- **Home-based** → Functional, context-based interventions, caregiver training

**Decision Point 3: What Does the Family Prioritize?**

- **Academic success** → Handwriting, attention strategies, organizational skills
- **Independence in daily living** → Self-care training, adaptive equipment
- **Social participation** → Play skills, sensory strategies, environmental supports
- **Cultural/religious participation** → Specific task training, family education

**Decision Point 4: Monitor and Adjust**

- **Progress evident** → Continue current approach
- **Minimal progress after 6-8 weeks** → Re-assess, consider alternative approach
- **New concerns emerge** → Adjust intervention plan
- **Goals achieved** → Generalization, new goals, or discharge
